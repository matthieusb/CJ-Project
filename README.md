# CJ-Project
CJ project is a scala-Play powered project which allows people to search for technology news on multiple sites at the same time (InfoQ, WikiCfp, Developpez.com(FR), IEEE, Youtube). It uses elements and pictures from Portal.

# Running
You will need a running mongoDB for it to work completely. Use the file situated in Scripts/BDD to create the correct database.
Then just go to Rendu/projet-veille-techno-1.0/bin and execute to run the application. It will then be availale on localhost:9000 (By default).
